Wrangle and Analyze Data from WeRateDogs Twitter account
- WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. It was started in 2015 by college student Matt Nelson, and has received international media coverage both for its popularity and for the attention drawn to social media copyright law when it was suspended by Twitter. WeRateDogs - Wikipedia.
- This project includes data wrangling processes through gathering, assessing, cleaning data, storing, and then the analysis and visualization of the results, and this is the second part of my report.
